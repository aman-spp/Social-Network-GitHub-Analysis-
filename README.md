# we analyse the Github network of our batchmates.
So to fetch(relevant data) data from github we required github api and performing various operation on it.
Assumption we take :-
    Nodes : User profiles of students of our batch.
    Edges : directed link if a node follows another node
what we did in this project :
1).Fetching Follower-following network for a specific user and we did it for everyone.
2).On the basis of above information we will create a directed graph b/w each other and visualizing it.
3).Plotting the degree distribution curve.
4).Centrality evaluation
    1.Degree Centrality
    2.Betweenness Centrality
    3.Closeness Centrality
    4.EigenVector Centrality
5).Finding the Hub and Authority Scores
6).Detecting Communities
7).Predicting Links between (Nodes which are not in connection).
    1.Neighbourhood Based
    2.Jaccard Coefficient
    3.Preferntial Attachment (PAC)
    4.Resource Allocation
    5.Adamic-Adar index
